It can generate graphs, text listings, and\ncalendars, or put a tide clock on your desktop. Xtide works through\nthree separate programs: the X Windows interface (xtide), the\nnon-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the web\ninterface (xttpd).\n\n<P>XTide uses the same algorithm to predict tides as the National\nOcean Service in the U.S. It is much more accurate than a simple tide\nclock from a novelty store. However, to predict tides accurately you\nalso need special data for every location for which you want to\npredict tides.  XTide reads this data from harmonics files that you\nmust get from Bob Kenney's web site,\nhttp://bel-marduk.unh.edu/xtide/files.html.\n\n<P>XTide's predictions are only as good as the available harmonics\ndata.  Due to issues of data availability and of compatibility with\nnon-U.S. tide systems, predictions for U.S. locations tend to be much\nbetter than for locations outside of the U.S.\n

Its core component is ROX-Filer, a graphical file manager that\nsupports `application directories:' directories which contain an\nentire application. When you open an application directory in the\nfiler the application runs. Therefore, installing an application is\nthe same as copying a directory, uninstalling is the same as deleting,\nand to install two different versions of the same application just\ncopy them to different directories on your hard disk. There is no need\nfor special setup programs or root access.\n\nTo read an application's help just choose Help from the filer menu\nto see it (it just opens a subdirectory inside the application *\ncalled 'Help'). There is no need for a separate filer and application\nlauncher. The filer does both, and you always know where your programs\nare. It also has drag-and-drop saving, which means you can save by\ndragging the file back from the application into the filer.

Having had many years of experience in developing the interactive data analysis systems PAW and PIAF and the simulation package GEANT, we realized that the growth and maintainability of these products, written in FORTRAN and using some 20 year old libraries, had reached its limits. Although still very popular, these systems do not scale up to the challenges offered by the LHC, where the amount of data to be simulated and analyzed is a few orders of magnitude larger than anything seen before.\nIt became time to re-think our approach to large scale data analysis and simulation and at the same time we had to profit from the progress made in computer science over the past 15 to 20 years. Especially in the area of Object-Oriented design and development. Thus was born ROOT.\n\nWe started the ROOT project in the context of the NA49 experiment at CERN. NA49 generates an impressive amount of data, about 10 Terabytes of raw data per run. This data rate is of the same order of magnitude as the rates expected to be recorded by the LHC experiments. Therefore, NA49 is an ideal environment to develop and test the next generation data analysis tools and to study the problems related to the organization and analysis of such large amounts of data. \n

1123	protoize	2010-05-03 16:09:21	221	http://directory.fsf.org/project/protoize		Creates or removes prototypes from C code	The program 'protoize' is an optional part of GNU\nC. You can use it to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the\nprogram to ANSI C in one respect. The companion program unprotoize\ndoes the reverse: it removes argument types from any prototypes that\nare found.\n\nThe user specifies a set of source files as command line\narguments. The conversion programs then compiles these files to see\nwhat functions they define. The specified files are all eligible to be\nconverted, as are any files they include (whether sources or just\nheaders).  \n\n<p>By default, protoize and unprotoize convert only source and header\nfiles in the current directory. Basic conversion with protoize\nconsists of rewriting most function definitions and function\ndeclarations to specify the types of the arguments. The only ones not\nrewritten are those for varargs functions.\n

Ping uses the\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo function.\n\nA small packet is sent through the network to a particular IP\naddress. This packet contains 64 bytes - 56 data bytes and 8 bytes of\nprotocol reader information. The computer that sent the packet then\nwaits (or 'listens') for a return packet. If the connections are good\nand the target computer is up, a good return packet will be\nreceived. PING can also tell the user the number of hops that lie\nbetween two computers and the amount of time it takes for a packet to\nmake the complete trip. Additionaly, an administrator can use Ping to\ntest out name resolution. If the packet bounces back when sent to the\nIP address but not when sent to the name, then the system is having a\nproblem matching the name to the IP address.

It is different than many other text-to-HTML programs in that the input format (by default a simple highly readable plain text format) can be customized by the user, and the output format (by default XHTML) can be user-defined. It can process complex structures such as ordered and unordered lists (nested or not), and add custom &amp;quot;headers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;footers&amp;quot; to documents. The conversion utilizes Perl regex, adding quite a bit of flexibility and power to the conversion process.

The oSIP home page\nincludes links to various useful SIP sites.\n\n'oSIP' is little in size and code and thus could be use to\nimplement IP soft-phone as well as embedded SIP software. oSIP is not\nlimited to endpoint agents, and can also be used to implement "SIP\nproxy".  It does not intend to provide a high layer API for\ncontrolling "SIP Session" at this step. Instead, it currently provides\nan API for the SIP message parser, SDP message parser, and library to\nhandle "SIP transactions" as defined by the SIP document.

Even with a single unit against ten\nopposing units, a player might still convert opposing units to his\nside and thus obtain the dominating position.\n

Online Grades is not a web-based gradebook. Instead, it accepts grade export information from several popular gradebook software programs such as Easy Grade Pro, Gradekeeper, Misty City's Grade Machine, and PGGP and places the grade information online securely.\nStudent, Teachers, Parents, and Administrators each get their own personal login into Online Grades, which allows them to see all of the grades in all of their classes. If parents have more than one student at a school or district, they only need one parent login to see the grades of all of their students.\n\nThe Online Grades software is free; there is no software cost to post your grade results online. However, to use the software, both an internet-accessible web server with PHP and access to a MySQL database are necessary. Because of these requirements, Online Grades is commonly set up and configured by a school or district tech person. If your school or district does not have the resources to set up Online Grades, you can alternatively buy hosting for your grades. Hosting is even available for individual teachers interested in using Online Grades.\n\nOnline Grades is free because the software is developed by volunteers and is in-part sponsored by the schools using the Online Grades software. Online Grades was originally based on the SourceForge project Basmati, and while backward compatibility has been maintained, Online Grades has many more features than the original Basmati grade posting software.\n

By default, Numdiff assumes the fields are separated by white spaces (blanks, horizontal tabulations and newlines), but the user can also specify its list of separators.\nWhen you compare a couple of such files, what you want to obtain usually is a list of the numerical fields in the second file which numerically differ from the corresponding fields in the first file. Well known tools like diff, cmp or wdiff can not be used to this purpose: they can not recognize whether a difference between two numerical fields is only due to the notation or is actually a difference of numerical values. Moreover, you could desire to neglect all small numerical differences too. However, programs like diff and wdiff can not be used to ignore small numerical differences, since they do not even know what a numerical difference is.\n

Nexuiz has been in development for close to 5 years by a team of amateur developers lead by Lee Vermeulen. It is a 3d deathmatch game made entirely over the internet. The purpose of the game is to bring deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon balancing and fast paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of realistic shooters. It uses HFX textures by Evil Lair, and currently has 17 maps to frag in. With an advanced UI, the user can select between 15 different player models to use, with an average of two skins for each, and can connect to our master server to play people from all over the world.\nThe game's content and source are GPL. Meaning, it is entirely free and any of it can be used in other free projects, even if modified. This is a first for any large game project of its type. We hope this will support the free game community, and encourage more GPL projects.\n\nNexuiz is based on the Darkplaces engine. The darkplaces engine is an advanced Quake1 engine developed mainly by Forest "LordHavoc" Hale, who has been working with the Quake1 engine for many years. A few of Darkplaces main features are Quake3bsp support, realtime lighting and shadowing, new particle effects, advanced menu system, and Md3/Md2 model support. Because Nexuiz is based on the Quake1 engine, its source code along with its content is entirely GPL. Nexuiz will also use the Quake1 game code language, called QuakeC, which makes modding the gameplay of the game extremely easy. This gamecode will be included with the release, and will allow anyone to mod it, and because it is entirely serverside you can use it on your servers even if the clients do not have your mod.\n

It supports almost all of the syntax that GNU make supports,\nand can be used with makefiles produced by utilities such as automake.\nIt is called makepp (or make++) because it was designed with special\nsupport for C++, which has since been extended to other languages like\nSwig or embedded SQL. Also its relationship to make is analogous to\nC++'s relationship to C: it is almost 100% backward compatible but adds\na number of new features and much better ways to write makefiles.\n\nSome features that makepp adds to make are: greatly improved handling of\nbuilds that involve multiple makefiles (recursive make is no longer\nnecessary); automatic scanning for include files; rebuilds triggered if\nbuild command changes; checksum-based signature methods for reliable\nbuilds, smart enough to ignore whitespace or comment changes;\nextensibility through perl (within your makefile); repositories\n(automatically importing files from another tree); build caches (not\nrecompiling identically what a user of the same cache already did).

LibTMCG is a C++ library for creating secure electronic card games. The most remarkable feature is the absence of a trusted third party (TTP), i.e. neither a central game server nor trusted hardware components are necessary. With the present library there is no need for an independent referee, because the applied protocols provide a basic level of confidentiality and fairness by itself. Consequently, the library is well-suited for peer-to-peer (P2P) environments where no TTP is available. Of course, we cannot avoid that malicious players share information about their private cards, but the protocols ensure that the shuffle of the deck is performed randomly (presumed that at least one player is honest) and thus the cards will be distributed uniformly among the players. Further, no coalition can learn the private cards of a player against his will (except for trivial conclusions). The corresponding cryptographic problem, actually called Mental Poker, has been studied since 1979 by many authors. LibTMCG provides the first practical implementation of such protocols.

GShow TV is globally usable as it uses XMLTV to access the program schedules, and xmltv has support for multitude of countries.\n<p> The interface between the recording software and the GUI is two trivial shell scripts, which are of course modifiable by the user as they see fit. The reason for this separation is simple: o GNU/linux almost everybody who has a TV card on their computer uses a different recording solution. The multitude of home-made recording systems is countless. However, most home-made systems don't include a nice GUI and hence GShow TV. Also as nowadays there are better PVR systems, like MythTV, VDR and Freevo, GShow TV makes a nifty remote frontend to these systems.

DRBD takes over the data, writes it to the\nlocal disk and sends it to the other host. On the other host, it takes\nit to the disk there. The other components needed are a cluster\nmembership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and an\napplication that works on top of a block device (ie, a filesystem and\nfsck).\n\n<P>Each device has either a 'primary' or 'secondary' state. The\napplication should run and access the device on the node with the\nprimary device. Every write is sent to the local 'lower level block\ndevice' and to the node with the device in 'secondary' state. The\nsecondary device then writes the data to its lower level block device.\nIf the primary node fails, heartbeat is switching the secondary device\ninto primary state and starts the application there. If the failed\nnode comes up again, it is a new secondary node and will synchronise\nits content to the primary node whithout interruption of service in\nthe background. Only those parts of the device that actually have been\nchanged will resync.\n

This is particularly useful\nfor big programs with many functions.\n\n<P>Checker maintains bitmaps to keep track of the status of each byte\nof memory. The status can be writable, readable, both, or none. When\nmemory is allocated, the new memory becomes write-only: you are not\nallowed to read it because it has not been initialized. But when you\nyou write to this new block, those bytes become readable and\nwritable. When the block is freed, the bytes become unreadable and\nunwritable. Red zones are unreadable and unwritable memory, so that\neach access to a red zone produces a warning.

Choose a point within the Local Group of galaxies, and Celestia\nwill show you an approximation of how it would appear to your eyes\nwere you actually there. Some of what Celestia shows is necessarily\nhypothetical--the farther away from Earth you get, the less real data\nthere is and the more guesswork is involved. Thus Celestia supplements\nobservational data with good guesses based on models of stellar and\nplanetary processes.\n\nYou can also navigate at an immense range of scales. Orbit a couple\nkilometers above the surface of a tiny, irregular asteroid, then head\noff toward Jupiter, watching it grow from a bright point of light into\na looming sphere filling your field of vision. Leave our solar system\nentirely and observe the sun as it fades from a brilliant disk to a\nbright star, disappearing almost entirely as you head off toward the\nUpsilon Andromeda system to orbit around its innermost giant planet.\n

It is the core of the scripting engine found in GNU Bayonne.\n\n<P>It is meant to be used where step execution is important, and where\neach step is in response to a callback event or a state machine\ntransition. It offers deterministic execution and low overhead so that\nmany concurrent instances can run together. However, in addition to\noffering step machine execution, GNU ccScript loads all scripts into\nan active image at once. This is for performance, as all operations in\nthe script system, to assure deterministic execution, are in memory.\n\n<P>GNU ccScript also offers the ability to load new scripts en\nmasse. Existing active sessions operate on the currently loaded\nscripts, and new sessions are offered the new script. When the last\nactive session on an old script set completes, the entire script set\nis flushed from memory, so you can operate scripted servers without\ndowntime for rebuilding script images in memory.\n

It was designed to replace the standard Unix 'crypt'\nutility, which is notorious for using a very weak encryption\nalgorithm. 'ccrypt' is based on the Rijndael cipher, which is the\nU.S. government's chosen candidate for the Advanced Encryption\nStandard (AES). This cipher is believed to provide very strong\nsecurity.\n\nUnlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric\n(one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt). Encryption and\ndecryption depend on a user-supplied keyword (key phrase). Keywords can be\nany number of characters; all characters are significant (although\nccrypt internally hashes the key to 256 bits). Longer keywords provide\nbetter security, since they are less likely to be discovered by\nexhaustive search.

Once a stack overflow has been exploited, the back trace\nis already gone, as is information about parameters and local\nvariables that are very important in understanding how the attacker is\nworking out the exploit.\n\n<P>The GMM library uses dynamic function call interception to catch\nthe most common functions that attackers use to exploit stack\nbuffers. It uses the LD_PRELOAD capability and offers two services:\nfirst, it avoids buffer overflow to allow the attacker to execute\nshell-code on your machine. Second, where an exploit is detected, it\nsaves the stack content and triggers a segmentation fault. The\nresulting core dump has the necessary information to debug the exploit\nand fix the software.\n
